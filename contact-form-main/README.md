## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete the form and see a success toast message upon successful submission - DONE
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A required field has been missed - DONE
  - The email address is not formatted correctly - NEED TO LOOK AT THIS
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, error messages, and the success message announced on their screen reader
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size - WIP
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

## My process

I started with the HTML and CSS styling on mobile for mobile-first before then starting on the javascript for the form validation.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS custom properties (CSS variables)
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

### Continued development

### Useful resources

- [MDN - Client Side Form Validation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Forms/Form_validation) - I knew some basics but I learnt about further built-in form validation e.g. pattern for regex matching
